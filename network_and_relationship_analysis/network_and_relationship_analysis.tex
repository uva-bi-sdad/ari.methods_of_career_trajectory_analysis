Career trajectories are profoundly shaped by the interconnected web of professional relationships and organizational networks that individuals navigate over time, making network and relationship analysis a critical lens for understanding career development. Social Network Analysis (SNA) offers a systematic framework for examining how the structure, density, and centrality of professional networks influence access to opportunities, resource distribution, and career advancement. By mapping relational patterns, SNA reveals how network positions—such as brokers bridging disconnected groups or central hubs within cohesive clusters—create advantages or constraints in career progression. Complementing this structural perspective, Mentorship and Sponsorship Studies focus on dyadic relationships that drive career growth, distinguishing between mentorship, which emphasizes guidance and skill development, and sponsorship, which involves active advocacy and opportunity provision by influential stakeholders.
