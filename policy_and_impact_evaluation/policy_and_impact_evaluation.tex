The study of career trajectoriesâ€”how requires methodologies capable of disentangling the complex interplay between policy interventions, labor market dynamics, and personal agency. Policy and impact evaluation provides a framework for systematically analyzing how institutional decisions, regulatory changes, and programmatic initiatives influence occupational outcomes, skill development, and long-term career sustainability. This chapter focuses on two methodological pillars: policy impact evaluation, which employs causal inference techniques to measure the real-world effects of implemented workforce policies on employment patterns, wage progression, and career mobility; and policy testing simulation, which utilizes computational models to project the potential consequences of proposed interventions before their adoption.
