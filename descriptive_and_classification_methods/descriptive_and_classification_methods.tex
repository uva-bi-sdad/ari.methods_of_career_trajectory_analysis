Career trajectories, defined as the evolving sequences of professional roles, transitions, and skill developments individuals experience over time, require robust analytical frameworks to unravel their complexity. Descriptive and classification methods offer systematic approaches to map, categorize, and interpret these dynamic pathways, enabling researchers to identify patterns, quantify transitions, and contextualize career development within broader structural and temporal frameworks. Career path mapping provides visual representations of potential routes and milestones, while sequence analysis techniques like optimal matching quantify similarities between career progression patterns. Statistical classification methods, including latent class analysis, uncover hidden subgroups with shared trajectory characteristics, and job classification systems standardize occupational categories to enable cross-organizational comparisons. Historical trend analysis contextualizes career pathways within evolving economic and technological landscapes, and demographic assessments reveal how factors like gender, education, and socioeconomic background shape career outcomes. Together, these methods form an integrated toolkit for dissecting career trajectories, balancing granular sequence analysis with macro-level structural insights to advance understanding of how careers unfold across individuals, industries, and generations.
